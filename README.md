### About Me

I’m Aaditya — a systems thinker at the intersection of research and engineering. My work bridges perception and intelligence — from robust vision transformers to retrieval-augmented solvers, and from gesture-based AMRs to scalable generative pipelines.

Currently pursuing a Ph.D. at **UCF**, I’ve previously engineered solutions at **Bosch**, **Siemens Energy**, and **AlphaBake**, and built models that aren’t just smart — they’re resilient, interpretable, and industrial-grade.
