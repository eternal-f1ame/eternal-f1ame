### About Me

I’m Aaditya — a systems thinker at the intersection of research and engineering. My work bridges perception and intelligence — from robust vision transformers to retrieval-augmented solvers, and from gesture-based AMRs to scalable generative pipelines.

Currently pursuing a Ph.D. at **UCF**, I’ve previously engineered solutions at **Bosch**, **Siemens Energy**, and **AlphaBake**, and built models that aren’t just smart — they’re resilient, interpretable, and industrial-grade.

### Areas of Focus

- Foundation Models in CV & NLP  
- Zero-/Few-Shot Learning & Multimodal Inference  
- Generative Modeling (Stable Diffusion, LoRA, IP Adapters)  
- Robotics Perception & Planning (ROS, OpenCV, PID)  
- Gradient-based Robustness & Adversarial Defense
