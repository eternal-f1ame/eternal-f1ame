🎯 **Who I Am**

I'm Aaditya — a Ph.D. researcher at **University of Central Florida**, deep into the worlds of **Computer Vision**, **Multimodal AI**, **Generative Models**, and **Human-Robot Interfaces**. I blend theory with grit — shaping real-world systems that detect hazards, interpret gestures, and even understand math word problems better than your calculator.

I’ve worked across **Bosch**, **Siemens Energy**, **AlphaBake**, and built models that *don’t just work — they adapt, scale, and fight adversarial attacks like champs*.

🧠 **What I Do Best**

- 🤖 Vision Transformers, Zero-shot Learning, GAN Robustness
- 📸 Foundation Models for Detection, Segmentation, and Reasoning
- ✋ Gesture-Guided Robotics (ROS + CV + LSTM + YOLO = 🔥)
- 📚 Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Math & Symbolic QA
- 🧵 Stable Diffusion + IP Adapters + LoRA Tuning
- ⚙️ CUDA Optimization | PyTorch, TensorFlow, ROS, OpenCV
- 🧪 Bridging Research & Deployment: Academic rigor with an engineer’s mindset
